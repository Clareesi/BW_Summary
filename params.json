  "body": "# Project Overview\r\nThe BeaverWorks Summer Institute was a four week program that taught high school students how to program an autonomous mini RACECAR that could navigate the world around it using sophisticated sensors and code. Each week, the students tackled a different aspect of the RACECAR, accumulating different skills and learning many useful algorithms that are sure to be applicable in the real world. A challenge at the end of each week made sure no student was lagging behind in understanding the concepts and implementations, and the final Grand Prix in the last week was a stellar opportunity for students to show case all they had learned throughout the duration of the camp. In addition to learning about programming autonomous racecars, the intriguing guest seminars and thoughtful communications classes each week showed students how they could prepare for success in the real world, whether their interests were in becoming an engineer, scientist, or entrepreneur.\r\n\r\n# Technical Breakdown\r\n## Week 1\r\n## Week 2\r\n## Week 3\r\n## Week 4\r\n## Conclusions\r\n\r\n# Personal Reflections\r\n\r\n# Citations",
